A simple calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This is a simple calculator with addition(+), subtraction(-), mulitiplication(x), division and modulus(%) operations.
The first input is for entering values by clicking on the number/operations buttons or via the keyboard. Alphabets cannot be entered.
The second input is read-only and just displays the result after evaluation of the expression in the first input.
Division by zero is taken care of. So are other miscellaneous possible errors in feeding in an expression (eg: entering only operators and no operands)
